# Lemonade # 
### Because what's in a name, right? ###

Lemonade is a [reasonably] easy-to-use feature-switching framework.  It currently allows for features to be obtained via app/web.config files, a RESTful service, or alternatively via an Sql provider of your choice.  Take a look <a href='http://thesheps.github.io/lemonade'>here</a> for supporting documentation!
